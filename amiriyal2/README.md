# ANUROOP   
this is ***ANUROOP***
I'm known of my activeness	
Completed my 10th,+1 and +2 with a good grade and expected a lot at mains but i didn't even qualify in it and now i came to know a reality that stoping at a point makes us to depress but wondering the world makes us learn a lot	
I'm so far intrested in using computers from a kid and grown up to know that the software feild is a place where a person should be there up to date like learning new things and making a good choice of selection and i also came to know the other side if a persons expectations break it maybe hard to digest but the intrest,skill,enthusiasm,hardwork can never stop anyone to do a good thing	
Finally i approached ***Gitam university*** to full fill my dream stone of being a major part of a company or a team whatever.. i'm ready to do anything for my good blessed future	
My hobbies are Singing,Swimming and few out door games.My hobbies takes a great place in getting over my tiredness and stress	
For me the best part of the day is night bcz it's the place where we'll be alone and we can question ourself what we did all the day	
My dream company is to work in GOOGLE from a kid it self...lol but the strongest word that i belive is *** I CAN DO IT ***
